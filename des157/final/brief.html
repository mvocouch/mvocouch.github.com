            <h2>Project Summary:</h2>
            <p>
                For my final project I will be iterating the Game Project to expand upon the game mechanics and add more content.

            <p>
                There is a game called <a href="https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">A Dark Room</a> which I have admired for many years.
                What I like about it is that it manages to create an immersive game atmosphere only using black text on a white background and sound effects.
                The game is effectively split into tabs at the top that represent different locations in the game. The first two of these are
                A Dark Room (which later changes to A Fire Lit Room) and A Silent Forest (which progressively changes to a cabin, a village, and then a town and etc.)
            </p>    
            <p> Although the interface is simple enough that it could fit the entire interface onto one screen the design choice of making these different "locations" in the UI
                creates the sensation of traveling to different locations in the game. In each tab the sound design reflects what's happening in each location, further
                immersing the player and re-iterating this feeling of travel.
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of design I think that the game is very successful. If I were to change anything it would be to be just a little bit more creative with the graphics.
                This could be as simple as picking a different font. However, part of the charm of the game is its simplicity, so changes to the look might detract more than they add.

            <p>Card Thief is a mobile game where the player plays a theif trying to navigate a castle or dungeon without being caught by numerous guards. You can get a good feel for the
                graphic design and mechanics on <a href="http://www.card-thief.com/">the game's website</a> because much of the art is lifted directly from the game. When you first open
                the website or the game the first thing you see is this mysterious building:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/thief1.png">
                <figcaption><a href="http://www.card-thief.com/">The Card Thief Website</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                When you scroll down the artwork depicting wooden scaffolding like one would find supporting the walls of an old mine shaft masterfully communicates that by scrolling 
                down in the UI your character is traveling below ground deep into the tunnels carved out below the building you were greeted with upon opening the website or game.
                On the website each level of the underground is a new section displays a video trailer, screen shots from the game, reviews, and card designs.

            <p>
                What I love about this game is the way it creates the atmosphere of traveling through a dungeon with fairly simple graphics. By making the mechanics a type of solitaire card
                game the game designers were able to limit the amount of art assets needed to create an immersive experience. The only thing that I think could be improved with the
                replay value of the game. It has a daily challenges which address this, but they aren't successful at bringing me back the game the way I wish they could.

            <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
            <p>
                My goal is create a kind of choose-your-own-adventure style role playing game similar to A Dark Room which uses card graphics to communicate the player's choices similarly to
                Card Thief. Since what I love about both games is the way they create immersion minimalistically I am going to try to create a middle ground between the two. The graphics will
                not be as elaborate as Card Thief since none of my cards will contain character art, but there will be some art assets unlike A Dark Room which at most has some ASCII art maps.

            <h2>Interaction Strategies:</h2>
            <p>
                The user will interact with the game by clicking on cards. As cards are dealt audio will play of the "flipping" sound a card makes when you flip it on a table top. Kind of like, "shwft!"
                After selecting a card an overlay will display text indicating what happens in the story based the player's choice. The text will fade into view from left to right to give it a magical
                feel. The player can continue by clicking anywhere, pressing enter, or pressing a button that says "continue."
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Experience Goals:</h2>
            <p>
                I want to give the user an experience similar to when you're reading a really good book and you become so immersed in the story that you forget that you're reading. I would love it if
                the user forgot they were playing an online card game and instead felt like they were going on an adventure through this story.
