        <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>
        <time datetime="2021-4-20">April, 20th, 2021</time>
        <h3>Reading; Impressions and Observations</h3>
        <p>
            The article assigned for this week ends with a checklist of questions that a designer should ask themselves when deciding whether to use window overlays, also known as modals. For this journal entry I will examine each question and answer it to the best of my ability.
        </p>
        <h3>When do we show the modal?</h3>
        <p>
            Modals should not be used for warnings or error messages because users may assume the page is full of virus-laden popups. Error messages should be embedded in the parent page instead. So when should we show a modal?
            Because the appearance of a modal can trigger the same reaction from the user as a pop-up, i.e. "Ugh, go away. I am trying to use this website right now," then the designer should ensure that a modal doesn't appear unexpectedly.
            The best way to do this is to have the modal be triggered by user interaction with the page, for example, clicking a "Log In" button triggering a prompt to enter your username and password is an appropriate time to show a modal.
        </p>
        <h3>How do we show the modal?</h3>
        <p>
            When a modal appears the parent page should darken, an effect called "light box", to draw attention to the modal and indicate to the user that they cannot interact with the parent page while the modal is open.
            Furthermore, the modal should appear near the top of the page, since different screen sizes may cause a lower-placed modal to appear off-screen. This could cause confusion in the user, seeing the parent page darken but not seeing a modal to interact with.
            As a general rule, modals should not be used for mobile device website designs because of potential screen size layout problems.
        </p>
        <h3>What should the modal look like?</h3>
        <p>
            Modals should include an exit button that can be clicked on or triggered with the keyboard for accessibility. Think of it this way: Would you rather the user close the modal, or leave your website all together?
            They should also include a descriptive title so the user knows the purpose of the modal. Buttons to interact with the modal should have clear names. For example, a "Cancel Membership" overlay with a "Cancel" button at the bottom is unintuitive.
            Am I confirming that I wish to cancel? Or am I cancelling the cancel? A better label for the button would be, "Yes, cancel my membership."
        </p>
        <h3>What information do we present and collect?</h3>
        <p>
            This is going to depend on the context. Sometimes you can use a modal to show media without losing the context of the parent page, for example, showing a larger image of a product for a user that is browsing your online store.
            Alternatively you can use a modal to display information that is not directly related to the context of a page. For example, a notification.
        </p>
        <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Modals are very common design elements in modern website design but they should not be used frivolously or in the wrong context. It's important to know when a modal is appropriate
            and what the exact purpose of the modal is that it can be designed in a user-friendly way. Poorly designed modals don't just frustrate users: they drive them away from your website!

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2021-4-15">April, 15th, 2021</h2>
        <h3>Reading; Impressions and Observations</h3>
        <p>
            Upon reviewing the assigned article what stood out to me was that many of the reccommendations were intuitive to me. That's something I have often noticed about learning: sometimes when you learn something you aren't introduced to any new information, but rather you simply have familiar information contextualized for you in a way you haven't seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since using the internet is now a universal requirement for interacting with modern world, I think we have all encountered and struggled with poorly designed forms in our recent memories. As a person with ADHD I am easily over-stimulated and so it's no surprise that I struggle with the phenemonen of "visual overwhelm" discussed in class on Tuesday. Seeing the suggestion that forms be separated into separate pages makes a lot of sense to me, because I have noticed that these types of forms are the most pleasing for me to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an additional observation, I have often found that with paperwork I tend to fill out the form out of order, scanning the page for the information that I can remember off the top of my head and going back and filling out the areas that require me to find my references, look up dates, and provide documentation. However, this approach often leads to errors because I miss spots and leave necessary areas blank. With that in mind, I found the suggestion that a form begin with the least-complicated questions a refreshing idea, since that mimics what my brain does naturally without presenting the possibility of forgetting to fill out important information. 
        </p>
            <h3>Evaluate; Considering the Design of a Specific Form</h3>
            <p>
                For my job I teach young students private lessons about coding and 3D modeling. The company I work for requires us to send an email to the student's parents after every session to outline what the student learned and how the lesson went. For this process we use a tool on the company website called the PSR or Post Session Report form.
            </p>

            <img src="images/formExample1.PNG" alt="An Email form is shown with input boxes for Internal notes, Concepts Covered, and Student Highlights with a green submit button at the bottom.">
            <h4>Pros:</h4>
            <p>What I like about this email form is it makes it easy to quickly identify all of the information that I need to know about the lesson, what needs to be included in the Post Session Report and the formatting gives it a visual style consistent with the company's brand. Upon clicking the button at the bottom I can preview the email that I am about to send and the form automatically includes an intro which addresses the client by name and the outro includes my email signature. On top of this content being automatically generated the email is also automatically formatted according to the visual style of the company's brand.
            </p>
            
            <img src="images/formExample2.PNG" alt= "An email preview is shown which contains much the same text from the previous form, but in this case it has been formatted the Company logo, headers, subheaders and a green Schedule Now button It has been formatted with accents of green. A button at the bottom says, 'Publish and Send'">
            <h5>Cons:</h5>
            <p>Since this is a form that I use everyday it's flaws have quickly become major pet peeves of mine. First of these is that the link that leads to this page is labelled "Go To Post Session Report" but upon loading the page shows all of the students lessons, not just today's lesson. This has led to me, on multiple occasions, accidentally "delivering" an email for the incorrect lesson. An issue which I cannot fix without contacting a manager. Annoying!
            The other frustration is that the page has not been designed to be light-weight resulting in a loading time of 2 to 3 seconds when first opening the page. This may not seem like that much time, but it is irritating because this is a form that I have to use every work day to send an email that has a time-deadline 4 minutes after class ends. I have gotten multiple warnings that I am sending PSR emails late, so that 2 to 3 seconds is extremely painful to sit through when I am racing the clock!
            </p>
            
            <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                While design can be a fun and creative endeavor we should always keep an mind that first and foremost the purpose of design is to create a pleasant user experience. While creating aesthetically pleasing web pages can be fun, we shouldn't let creative expression get in the way of the user's experience. Forms are one such area where much of the room for creativity is stripped away, leaving the bare bones of usability. Nobody cares that a form is pretty if it's unusable.
