        <h2>Game UX Best Practices</h2>
        <time datetime="2021-5-17">May, 17th, 2021</time>
        <p>The article <a href= "https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices by Amir Dori</a> has some useful insights:
            Firstly, make sure that any "pop-ups" or overlays don't have an "x" to exit out of them, because users may automatically click the "x"
            without reading the pop-up content. Secondly, keep in mind: most users are right handed, so we should design mobile games understanding
            that the users thumb can most easily reach certain parts of the screen, while other parts are more difficult to reach.
            I hadn't considered this latter concept and it gave me the idea that maybe any games I design for mobile could have a "left-handed" mode that is easier for left-handed users to
            operate. However, most of the article focuses on manipulating the user to spend money. This genuinely infuriated me.</p>
        <p>The average mobile game user spends little to no money on mobile games but freemium 
            games target "whales": the handful of users that make up for 90% of a freemium games profit. People with addictive or impulsive personality
            disorders are highly vulnerable to being taken advantage of and becoming whales. To me, freemium game design that purposefully manipulates
            whales into spending more money is akin to selling drugs to a drug addict. Then again, drug dealers don't usually sell to children. (See: <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/12/this-6-year-old-racked-up-over-16k-on-his-moms-credit-card/">6-year-old racks up $16K on momâ€™s credit card playing video games</a>)
        </p>
        <p>Freemium game design especially angers me because the goal isn't to make a good game. The goal is to tease the user
            with the possibility of a good game, and then pelt them with as many ads as possible. Many of these games purposefully design the
            levels to be impossible to complete if you don't pay money to buy power ups or watch ads to "earn" those power ups. Just one example of how these games implement a "pay to win" model is giving the user a time limit
            to complete a level and setting it to such a small amount of time that it's literally impossible to beat the level if you don't have a timer boost power up. And this is even done to users that have already paid for the poorly named "no ads" feature! If you look at the
            reviews under these types of games you'll notice that they invariably have tons of one star reviews complaining about the number of ads
            or complaining that you can't win the levels without paying for powerups.
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion, my goal when I set out to make a game is to make a <italics>good</italics> game that people will pay for because they
            genuinely enjoy playing! Not because the game is impossible to enjoy if you don't pay to win. The author may have made hundreds of games in his career, but I would much rather make a small handful
            of games that I can be proud of than hundreds of games that empty people's wallets instead of giving them joy.</p>

        <h2>Every Picture: Visual Thinking Analysis Learning Journal</h2>
        <time datetime="2021-5-6">May, 6th, 2021</time>
        <h3>Part One:</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/teenGirl.jpg">
            <figcaption>An image of my 3D character Model, Leah. For the game Haunt This House</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <h3>What and how is this image interesting?</h3>
        <p>
            What I think is interesting about the image is it shows how simple a character concept can be. Additionally, the image has multiple frames of animation that shows a full turn around of the 3D character.
        </p>
        <h3>How does this image relate to the topic of your archive or collection?</h3>
        <p>
            While the game has no main character, per se, Leah is the character that I have the strongest emotional connection to. Since the game is semi-autobiographical every character represents a different part of my life. Leah represents who I was when I was going through undiagnosed depression as a teenager. Her long blonde hair and name are inspired from my best friend in highschool who I bonded with because we were going through similar emotional struggles at the time. Her baggy hoodie represents the desire to hide away from the world, to keep oneself comforted by isolating and separating oneself.
        </p>
        <h3>How does your collection or archive say (i.e. tell a story) about you?</h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned in the previous question/answer, the game Haunt This House is semi-autobiographical. All of the characters represent different stages of my emotional development. Since the other charcters haven't been designed yet, this archive currently focuses just on Leah. But the archive also tells a story about my creative process for creating the game Haunt this House.
        </p>

        <h3>Part Two:</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/pic5Peter.jpg">
            <figcaption>Peter Lo's image of an alley market on a cloudy day.</figcaption> 
        </figure>
        <h3>What is this image about?</h3>
        <p>
            The image's focal point are two people who appear to have forgotten to bring their umbrella to the market that day and it has apparently begun to sprinkle because they are surrounded by a crowd of people who have already pulled out umbrellas to protect themselves from the drizzle. The image is about these two people and their feelings in that moment. What may have been a lovely outting appears to have turned a bit inconvenient.
        </p>
        <h3>What are the most interesting aspects of this image?</h3>
        <p>
            The colors communicate the feeling of dreariness of a cloudy day, contrasted again the brightly colored trees, umbrellas and market decorations in the background. It separates the two "main characters" out from the crowd contrasting their experience against the experience of the crowd. I also like how the perspective lines of the photograph, due to the alley way, push outward toward the viewer further pushing focus towards our two "main characters."
        </p>
        <h3>What are the most obvious and the most mysterious aspects of this image?</h3>
        <p>
            What is obvious to me is that the crowd has gathered for some kind of public family-friendly event, due to the differerent people in the crowd that I see are with their children. Furthermore, it's obvious that it's a cloudy, rainy day because of the color grading of the image and the presence of so many umbrellas among the crowd. What is mysterious is that it is unclear what exactly the event in question is. I assumed some kind of outdoor market, but is the a usual affair like a farmer's market? Or perhaps a special holiday? Since all we can see are the crowds, not what they are gathered for exactly, we can't be sure why they are gathered in this location, only that it is a popular gathering that people are willing to attend despite the chance of bad weather.

        <h2>Every Picture: Visual Literacy</h2>
        <time datetime="2021-4-28">April, 28th, 2021</time>
        <h3>Goldilock's and the Three Websites</h3>

        <p>While searching for websites that use images in creative ways I quickly noticed that many websites tend to fall in one of two categories: Very creative and beautiful but almost unusable because it is not clear how to use the site, or websites that are bland in design but easy to navigate.</p>
        
        <h3>Mama Bear</h3>

            <img src="images/playlist.png">
            <p>For example, I would have liked to write about <a href="https://tote.design/cure/">this playlist website</a> which has a beautiful color scheme and a shimmering crystal at the center of it's three dimensional design. But it took much too long for me to figure out the interface. The user drags their mouse to rotate the 3D view, but hovering the mouse over a triangle causes a song to preview. Since the view rotation is controlled by the mouse it's not clear that it's the hovering, not the rotating, that triggers the music. This also causes the music turn on and off in a jarring way as you move your mouse over the triangles to rotate the view. If the user can't figure out the hover action then there is no hope for them to figure out that clicking a triangle will bring up more information about the song and allow the song to play through to the end.</p>

        <h3>Papa Bear</h3>
            
            <img src="images/banksy.png">
            <p>After this disappointing experience I remembered that I've always liked <a href="https://www.banksy.co.uk/menu.asp">Banksy's website</a> but it's been a long time since I have seen it so I decided to go check it out. The content does not disappoint, the homepage has a humorous Bob Ross parody that was worth the price of admission. (Seeing as the price of admission is just a click.) But it was immediately apparent to me that I couldn't write much about this website because it's design is purposefully bland. This is perfect for a portfolio website since it let's the art speak for itself, but it wasn't what I was looking for.</p>
            
        <h3>Baby Bear</h3>
        
            <img src="images/wickware.png">
            <p>I didn't find my Goldilock's website until I stumbled upon the design portfolio of <a href="http://laurenwickware.com/#/">Lauren Wickware.</a> Although I am not a huge fan of how sticky the scroll action is, I quickly got used to the fact that I had to scroll quickly to snap to the next image. The most impressive aspect of Lauren Wickware's website is the use of color to create a cohesive portfolio.<br>As the user scrolls down the homepage, the page snaps to view after view of different book covers, magazine spreads, and posters that Wickware has designed. Each photograph is displayed with a pastel colored tinted overlay that matches the other half the screen. This means that as the user scrolls down the page every image fits into this cohesive color scheme. But, if the user wishes to view the true-to-color version of the photographs they need only hover their mouse over the image. Elegantly simple.<br>Within seconds of looking at the homepage I discovered a sidebar menu that gives the user access to an index that lists all of Wickware's design projects and the linked list snaps the page to whichever project is selected. What impressed me the most about this design is that I only read 6 words of text at the top of the page and was on the website for less than 15 seconds before I understood that Lauren is a prolifi designer responsible for the design of 52 different graphic design projects and all of this information was communicated to me <i>without even opening an About Me section.</i> Amazing.</p> 
            
        <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
            
            <p>Visual story telling is a difficult task, as any illustrator or print designer can attest to, but designing a website provides the unique challenge of the additional requirement that the user interaction is intuitive and responsive. The admirable balance of user-friendly but beautiful design exemplified by Lauren Wickware's website is what I will be striving for as I plan the next class project.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>
        <time datetime="2021-4-20">April, 20th, 2021</time>
        <h3>Reading; Impressions and Observations</h3>
        <p>
            The article assigned for this week ends with a checklist of questions that a designer should ask themselves when deciding whether to use window overlays, also known as modals. For this journal entry I will examine each question and answer it to the best of my ability.
        </p>
        <h3>When do we show the modal?</h3>
        <p>
            Modals should not be used for warnings or error messages because users may assume the page is full of virus-laden popups. Error messages should be embedded in the parent page instead. So when should we show a modal?
            Because the appearance of a modal can trigger the same reaction from the user as a pop-up, i.e. "Ugh, go away. I am trying to use this website right now," then the designer should ensure that a modal doesn't appear unexpectedly.
            The best way to do this is to have the modal be triggered by user interaction with the page, for example, clicking a "Log In" button triggering a prompt to enter your username and password is an appropriate time to show a modal.
        </p>
        <h3>How do we show the modal?</h3>
        <p>
            When a modal appears the parent page should darken, an effect called "light box", to draw attention to the modal and indicate to the user that they cannot interact with the parent page while the modal is open.
            Furthermore, the modal should appear near the top of the page, since different screen sizes may cause a lower-placed modal to appear off-screen. This could cause confusion in the user, seeing the parent page darken but not seeing a modal to interact with.
            As a general rule, modals should not be used for mobile device website designs because of potential screen size layout problems.
        </p>
        <h3>What should the modal look like?</h3>
        <p>
            Modals should include an exit button that can be clicked on or triggered with the keyboard for accessibility. Think of it this way: Would you rather the user close the modal, or leave your website all together?
            They should also include a descriptive title so the user knows the purpose of the modal. Buttons to interact with the modal should have clear names. For example, a "Cancel Membership" overlay with a "Cancel" button at the bottom is unintuitive.
            Am I confirming that I wish to cancel? Or am I cancelling the cancel? A better label for the button would be, "Yes, cancel my membership."
        </p>
        <h3>What information do we present and collect?</h3>
        <p>
            This is going to depend on the context. Sometimes you can use a modal to show media without losing the context of the parent page, for example, showing a larger image of a product for a user that is browsing your online store.
            Alternatively you can use a modal to display information that is not directly related to the context of a page. For example, a notification.
        </p>
        <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Modals are very common design elements in modern website design but they should not be used frivolously or in the wrong context. It's important to know when a modal is appropriate
            and what the exact purpose of the modal is that it can be designed in a user-friendly way. Poorly designed modals don't just frustrate users: they drive them away from your website!

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2021-4-15">April, 15th, 2021</h2>
        <h3>Reading; Impressions and Observations</h3>
        <p>
            Upon reviewing the assigned article what stood out to me was that many of the reccommendations were intuitive to me. That's something I have often noticed about learning: sometimes when you learn something you aren't introduced to any new information, but rather you simply have familiar information contextualized for you in a way you haven't seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since using the internet is now a universal requirement for interacting with modern world, I think we have all encountered and struggled with poorly designed forms in our recent memories. As a person with ADHD I am easily over-stimulated and so it's no surprise that I struggle with the phenemonen of "visual overwhelm" discussed in class on Tuesday. Seeing the suggestion that forms be separated into separate pages makes a lot of sense to me, because I have noticed that these types of forms are the most pleasing for me to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an additional observation, I have often found that with paperwork I tend to fill out the form out of order, scanning the page for the information that I can remember off the top of my head and going back and filling out the areas that require me to find my references, look up dates, and provide documentation. However, this approach often leads to errors because I miss spots and leave necessary areas blank. With that in mind, I found the suggestion that a form begin with the least-complicated questions a refreshing idea, since that mimics what my brain does naturally without presenting the possibility of forgetting to fill out important information. 
        </p>
            <h3>Evaluate; Considering the Design of a Specific Form</h3>
            <p>
                For my job I teach young students private lessons about coding and 3D modeling. The company I work for requires us to send an email to the student's parents after every session to outline what the student learned and how the lesson went. For this process we use a tool on the company website called the PSR or Post Session Report form.
            </p>

            <img src="images/formExample1.PNG" alt="An Email form is shown with input boxes for Internal notes, Concepts Covered, and Student Highlights with a green submit button at the bottom.">
            <h4>Pros:</h4>
            <p>What I like about this email form is it makes it easy to quickly identify all of the information that I need to know about the lesson, what needs to be included in the Post Session Report and the formatting gives it a visual style consistent with the company's brand. Upon clicking the button at the bottom I can preview the email that I am about to send and the form automatically includes an intro which addresses the client by name and the outro includes my email signature. On top of this content being automatically generated the email is also automatically formatted according to the visual style of the company's brand.
            </p>
            
            <img src="images/formExample2.PNG" alt= "An email preview is shown which contains much the same text from the previous form, but in this case it has been formatted the Company logo, headers, subheaders and a green Schedule Now button It has been formatted with accents of green. A button at the bottom says, 'Publish and Send'">
            <h5>Cons:</h5>
            <p>Since this is a form that I use everyday it's flaws have quickly become major pet peeves of mine. First of these is that the link that leads to this page is labelled "Go To Post Session Report" but upon loading the page shows all of the students lessons, not just today's lesson. This has led to me, on multiple occasions, accidentally "delivering" an email for the incorrect lesson. An issue which I cannot fix without contacting a manager. Annoying!
            The other frustration is that the page has not been designed to be light-weight resulting in a loading time of 2 to 3 seconds when first opening the page. This may not seem like that much time, but it is irritating because this is a form that I have to use every work day to send an email that has a time-deadline 4 minutes after class ends. I have gotten multiple warnings that I am sending PSR emails late, so that 2 to 3 seconds is extremely painful to sit through when I am racing the clock!
            </p>
            
            <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                While design can be a fun and creative endeavor we should always keep an mind that first and foremost the purpose of design is to create a pleasant user experience. While creating aesthetically pleasing web pages can be fun, we shouldn't let creative expression get in the way of the user's experience. Forms are one such area where much of the room for creativity is stripped away, leaving the bare bones of usability. Nobody cares that a form is pretty if it's unusable.
